<h1>Documentation creation overview</h1>

<p>
    JSGUI documentation builds using a <code>GenDoc.exe</code> tool. The tool performs the following tasks:
</p>

<@item title="generate doc pages">

    <p>
        The GenDoc.exe tool scans the doc source directory, and creates an output page file for each input page file. 
        Input files are HTML files containing a page content only (without tags like <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> etc.)
        Some input files have <code>.xml</code> file type instead of <code>.html</code> - just because I was not happy by the Visual Studio HTML editor.
        The <code>.xml</code> source files are HTML files in fact.
    </p>

    <p>
        GenDoc.exe wraps the source files in a page template, and processes custom tags like <code>&lt;@section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;@item&gt;</code> etc.
        The page template is <code>DocWebSite/templates/page-template-dev.html</code> or <code>DocWebSite/templates/page-template.html</code> file
        (for developer's and user's versions respectively).
    </p>

    <p>
        GenDoc.exe creates navigation links for the pages (the "Table of contents:" section in the left column). 
        In addition to the doc source directory, it scans js source directory creating a placeholders for the files that are not documented yet.
    </p>

</@item>

<@item title="generate issues pages">

    <p>
        GenDoc.exe interpretes <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> HTML tags as issue indication. It builds the "Known issues:" section in the left column
        referencing the issues summary pages for the output pages containing issues.
    </p>

</@item>

<@item title="generate test pages">

    <p>
        GenDoc.exe executes unit test files (<code>.spec.js</code> files) from the test directory, and creates test result pages.
        The "Tests" section on the left column contains the tests navigation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The tests navigation contains a summary info for the test files and directories. There are the following kinds of the summary numbers:
    </p>
    <dl class="doc">

        <dt>Passed</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>How many tests are passed, e.g. <span class='infoPassed' title='passed tests'>5</span></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Failed</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>How many tests are failed, e.g. <span class='infoFailed' title='failed tests'>2</span></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Pending</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>How many tests are pending for some reason, e.g. <span class='infoPending' title='pending tests'>1</span></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Error</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>How many tests files was unable to be executed, e.g. <span class='infoError' title='error: test file not executed'>2</span></p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Issues and big issues</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                In addition to the traditional test states (passed/failed/pending), JSGUI adds "Issues" and "Big issues" criterions.
                They are independent from traditional ones. So, the passed/failed state indicates if the test meets the actual code behaviour, 
                or the test is obsolete and must be updated for the new code version. The issues shows how good the tested code is.
            </p>

            <p>
                The big issues indicate serious problems. To mark test as containing big issue you can add "!!!!!" (5 exclamation marks) to the
                test code as a comment. Also you can add "!!!!!" to the documentation (preferably inside  <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> HTML tag),
                then this documentation item will be exclude4d from the user's documentation version.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Ordinary" issues indicate problems that are not critical. To mark test as containing issue you can add "!!!" (3 exclamation marks) to the
                test code as a comment.
            </p>

            <p>
                If a test summary contains big issues, then it shows both big and ordinary issues count 
                separated by "+" (even if the ordinary issues count equals to zero), e.g. <span class='infoIssues' title='tests with issues and big issues'><strong>4</strong>+84</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                If a test summary contains ordinary issues (without big ones), then it shows just ordinary issues count,
                e.g. <span class='infoIssues' title='tests with issues'>4</span>
            </p>
        </dd>

    </dl>
